<p> &nbsp One way of practicing Java Language is Android Studio Framework. I gradually moved from simple applications,
  that did not require a complicated structure or UI, to relatively more complex ones.
  Having different classes and creating more complex objects along with Data Base queries,
  Asynchronous threads and a more interactive UI, has been a great practice for developing debugging skills and
  Object Oriented Programming insight.<br><br>

&nbspAmong other applications, I have built a complete calendar app from scratch, including the graphical images.

The app is published on Google Play and can be
seen <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wallpapernote.plutopix.wallpaperorganizer">here</a>.

Also, the source code can be seen <a href="https://github.com/PaulCrisan/android-calendar-app.git">here</a>. </p>
